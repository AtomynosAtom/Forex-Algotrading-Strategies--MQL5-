# Forex Algotrading Strategies [MQL5]

## What this is

This repository is a collection of foreign exchange (FX) trading strategies written in MQL5 and designed to be compiled  
and executed with Metatrader 5.

## Motivator behind this project

During H2 2023, I began manually trading a $10,000 pepperstone account, to which I managed to turn into $20,000 in a few months. This gave me a trader's / newbie's high that ultimately led to my demise as I gave back the $10,000 profit in just a
single trading week that was riddled with emotional weakness and hubris.

As a result, I have stopped manually trading and am exploring the world of algorithmic trading as a way to force myself to trade a system emotionlessly.
